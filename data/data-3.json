It\u2019s likely this is the last we\u2019ll see of Mock Apple.\n\n**Blueberry Peach Custard (5) over Lemon Meringue (4), 22-19**\n\nIt was a nail biter, but in the end Lemon Meringue disappoints again and Blueberry Peach Custard gets a ticket to face off against its sibling Blueberry.\n\n**Haitian Sweet Potato (6) over Chocolate Cherry Chess (3), 28-13**\n\nShocking result for this one! The reincarnation of last year\u2019s winner loses in a first-round upset to upstart Haitian Sweet Potato. HSP held a comfortable lead throughout the week and is already a hot upset pick in round 2.\n\n**Strawberry Rhubarb (2) over S\u2019mores (7), 30-11**\n\nFormer champion Strawberry Rhubarb handles S\u2019mores quite easily in this first round matchup. This continues a trend of chocolate pies that aren\u2019t named Mississippi Mud having a tough time in the first round.\n\n**Maple Bourbon Brown Butter Peach (1) over Chocolate Pretzel (8), 21-20**\n\nWOW this one was close! Chocolate Pretzel actually held a lead the held through the first few days, but ultimately MB3P squeaks out a victory and prevents the second ever 8 seed victory. MB3P fans must feel awfully nervous after this performance though.\n\n**Lemon Raspberry (5) over Brown Butter Pecan (4), 22-19**\n\nBrown Butter Pecan may have lots of deep flavor, but it didn\u2019t have enough to pull off the win over Lemon Raspberry. Lemon Raspberry now gets ready to face off against a second straight Brown Butter pie.\n\n**Mixed Berry Cobbler Pie (3) over Orange Creamsicle (6), 28-13**\n\nThe first ever Cobbler Pie wins this one in resounding fashion. If Mixed Berry Cobbler Pie wins another matchup or two, expect to see another cobbler pie in 2022.\n\n**Key Lime (2) over Black Bottom Oatmeal (7), 27-14**\n\nWith a resounding victory from Key Lime and weak win from MB3P, Key Lime looks ahead to the next round as perhaps the favorite of the MB3P region.\n\n**Oreo Nutella (1) over Shoofly (8), 29-12**\n\nIs Oreo Nutella a corporate pie or is it just delicious? This dividing pie is nonetheless able to win easily over Shoofly, but not without some first round controversy.\n\n**Maple Cream (5) over Pumpkin Meringue (4), 28-13**\n\nPumpkin Meringue never had much of a chance in this one. It\u2019s a little surprising to see such a classic pie lose in the first round, but Pie Experts are now wondering if this pie should stay in its classic form.\n\n**Banoffee (3) over Coconut Cream (6), 29-12**\n\nThis was a controversial matchup for the cream team because I guess Banoffee is a cream pie for some reason?? But Coconut Cream just wasn\u2019t able to get any momentum once again.\n\n**Apple Cranberry Slab (7) over Chocolate Banana Cream (2), 21-20**\n\nA total shocker! Though we\u2019ve seen an 8 seed win in 2019 (Mocha Cream over Banana Cream), this marks the first time in Pie Madness history a 7 seed has ever won a matchup. While this sends a message to all future Pie Selection Committees that perhaps Banana Cream isn\u2019t a premier pie, it also marks the introduction of a new Pie Madness darling: Apple Cranberry Slab.\n\n**Apple (1) over Crust (8), 27-14**\n\nAlas, Crust wasn\u2019t able to pull off the major upset as Apple easily moves on to the next round. The joke\u2019s on everyone though, since no matter which pie wins it all, it will definitely have crust.\n\n**Strawberry Cheesecake (4) over PB+J (5), 22-19**\n\nPB+J took an early lead, but in the end Strawberry Cheesecake was able to go on a solid run at the end and emerge victorious.\n\n**Guava Cream Cheese Hand Pies (6) over Peanut Butter (3), 24-17**\n\nAnother shocker! Though Peanut Butter has been trending upwards recently, this first round exit will be a big blow to PB fans all over. For Guava Cream Cheese Hand Pies, this marks a historic victory as GCCHP are now the first single serving pie to ever win a matchup in Pie Madness\n\n**Mississippi Mud (2) over Egg Nog Cream (7), 33-8**\n\nAnd to cap it all off, Mississippi Mud flexed its muscles over upstart Egg Nog Cream to come away with the biggest margin of victory this round. With only 8 votes it\u2019ll take a lot of public fan support this offseason to see Egg Nog Cream make an appearance in 2022."}, "PK": {"S": "POST#CONTEST#2021"}, "title": {"S": "Round 1 Results!"}}}}, {"PutRequest": {"Item": {"hasPoll": {"BOOL": false}, "pollTitle": {"NULL": true}, "poll": {"NULL": true}, "image": {"S": ""}, "number": {"N": "0"}, "timestamp": {"N": "1614625187148"}, "user": {"S": "USER#cbe4971d-44e0-4caa-ba4c-40716c2e9982"}, "SK": {"S": "POST#cd9d42d6-990a-4b00-8f8b-84bdbb3986a1"}, "text": {"S": "The bracket contest is also still ongoing.
