# Pie Madness API

This repo contains the API code for piemadness.com, a website / forum where pie fans can chat amongst themselves about the annual Pie Madness contest where pie flavors compete in a bracket format. 

## Steps to get pie madness backend running locally

The data for piemadness.com has been copied with crtical user info obfuscated. This gives you a chance to run the website locally just as it runs live on piemadness.com by running a local instance of dynamodb and using SAM local.

If you'd like to install everything all at once before going through these instructions, you'll need to already have or install
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) 
- [SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/install-sam-cli.html)
These can all be installed with Brew if you prefer

1. Clone the code from the repo to your machine

2. Download and install Docker desktop if you havenâ€™t already. Run `docker-compose up` in the root of the project. This will install a local dockerized instance of dynamodb on your machine. Use docker desktop to confirm that your database is running. You can also confirm with the AWS cli by running `aws dynamodb list-tables --endpoint http://localhost:8000` in your terminal. The list of tables should be empty.

3. Run the create_db script by running `npm run create_db` in the root of the /api directory. Now if you run `aws dynamodb list-tables --endpoint http://localhost:8000` you should see the tables. Then, run the insert_data script by running `npm run insert_data` in the root of the /api directory. Check if this succeeds by running `aws dynamodb scan --table-name pie_madness_local --endpoint http://localhost:8000`

5. Run `npm install` at root of /api directory to install npm packages.

6. Navigate back to the root of this repo. Install the sam cli with Brew or according to aws official documentation. Run `sam local start-api`. This should start a local instance of the pie madness API with data from your local dynamodb instance. Try it out by going to localhost:3000/posts/contestId/2023 in your browser
